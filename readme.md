The Beauty and Joy of Computing is one of the most popular courses in the computer science curriculum at UC Berkeley. [Critically acclaimed on campus](http://goo.gl/cAjnvF), the class aims to provide a fast-paced and accessible intro to the big ideas of computing.

This summer, Jina Yoon and I are bringing this course from Berkeley to Cerritos! We’ve been planning this for a whole  semester and we’re super excited to teach about a subject that, despite greatly affecting our daily lives, is largely understated in our schools' curriculum today.

Projects range from a word-guessing game to creating an evil AI for hangman. The course culminates in an open-ended design project where you and a team will apply your skills to the real world!
